# Julia-XAI: Explainable AI in Julia
The Julia-XAI ecosystem hosts [Explainable AI (XAI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) 
methods written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org),
with a focus on post-hoc, local input-space explanations of black-box models.
In simpler terms, methods that try to answer the question 
*"Which part of the input is responsible for the model's output?"*.

## Where to start
##### New users:
Our recommended starting point into the Julia-XAI ecosystem is the 
[Getting started](@ref docs-getting-started) guide.

##### New developers:
If you want to implement a method, take a look at the [common interface
defined in XAIBase.jl](@ref docs-interface).

## Contributing
We welcome all contributions to the Julia-XAI ecosystem.
