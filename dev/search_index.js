The following methods can be selected, which are then applied over the color channels for each \"pixel\" in the array:\n:sum: sum up color channels\n:norm: compute 2-norm over the color channels\n:maxabs: compute maximum(abs, x) over the color channels\nDefaults to :sum.\nrangescale::Symbol: Selects how the color channel reduced heatmap is normalized before the color scheme is applied.
